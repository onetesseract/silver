#### (possibly) the most cursed programming language you'll ever see (no guarantees)  
readme is a WIP because its almost 11pm and im too tired to be sensible and write sanely rn

#### Todo List:
- [X] Structs
- [X] Struct access syntax (`x.y` with `y` a variable)
- [X] Typedefs - i still wanna rethink them maybe
- [X] Pointers and referencing/dereferencing
- [X] Bitcasting
- [X] Struct function access syntax
- [X] If statements
- [ ] Loops!
  - [X] While loops - Done but untested - ~~update: they break everything~~ no it was me
